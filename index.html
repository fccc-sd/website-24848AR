            <h1> Where im from! </h1>    
        <p> My name is Aiden Riley, im originally from Ohio, but i've lived in other
         states for a small portion of my life. The states i can rememebr are ohio,
         Tennessee, and North Carolina. When i was really young, i lived in North Carolina. 
         im not too sure when i moved up to Tennessee, but i was there until the end of my second grade year.
         after that, we moved up to Ohio where i've lived ever since.  </p> 
 

        
            <h3> Some hobbies i have</h3>
        <p> 
        I have a few hobbies, granted i enjoy some more than others. My first hobby is hiking. Its not something i typically do often,
        but its still there. Another one that is in the simialr boat is fishing. I dont go fishing alone, but it's still enjoyable.
        Travaling is another "hobby" i guess. its one of those things where you kinda have to except it. Thats because my grandparents like to take me travaling around the us.
        I havn't been anywhere far from Ohio, only the neigboring states. My main hobby tho is gaming. Im huge into gaming, my favorite one is <br> <strong> Dead Space. </strong>
